### Recommendations
- Implement tutoring programs for students studying less than 2 hours.
   
- Enhance internet access for students to facilitate online learning.

- Students from larger families may have different support systems and resource availability compared to those from smaller families.
  
- Higher parental education levels appear to positively influence student performance.
  
### Conclusion

This project looked at what affects studentsâ€™ school performance. We found that students who study more and have parents with higher education tend to do better in their exams. Many students are not studying enough, which is a concern.
To help students succeed, we recommend offering more study support and getting families involved in their education. By doing this, we can create a better learning environment for everyone.
